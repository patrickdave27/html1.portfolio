<h1>The Best Movies According to Patrick De Vega</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Fast and Furious</h3>
<p>You already know. <br>
Fast cars and cool stunts make it gnarly</p>
<h3>The Transporter Lineup</h3>
<p>Can't go wrong whenever Jason Statham casts on it. <br>
The action, stunts, cool cars, and cool missions</p>
<h3>John Wick series</h3>
<p>Do I really need to say it? Anybody knows John Wick or Babayaga</p>
